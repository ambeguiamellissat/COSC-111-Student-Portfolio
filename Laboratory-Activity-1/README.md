# Laboratory Activity 1 – Working with Digital Signals

### [📌 Folder: `Activity1_DigitalSignals`](./Laboratory-Activity-1)

### Description
This activity focuses on using **digital signals** in Arduino.  
A running light circuit is created where LEDs turn on and off sequentially using `digitalWrite()`.

### Key Features
- Uses pins **8 to 12**
- LEDs turn ON one by one (from 12 to 8)
- LEDs turn OFF one by one (from 12 to 8)
- Uses `delay(1000)` for 1-second intervals

### Files Included:
1. `.ino` sketch file
2. Breadboard diagram (TinkerCad)
3. Members’ grades
